# Personas

This project is designed around users who benefit from hands-free
interaction when traditional touch-based input is impractical or
inaccessible. The following personas were created to guide interaction
design decisions throughout the project.

---

## Primary Persona: The Home Cook

**Name:** Alex  
**Age:** 24  
**Occupation:** University student / young professional  

### Context
Alex frequently cooks at home while following online recipes displayed
on a laptop or tablet. Their hands are often wet, greasy, or covered
in food, making touch interaction inconvenient and unhygienic.

Alex may also use a **shared public kitchen** (library, workshop) or
**laboratory-like scenario** where contamination must be avoided.

### Goals
- Read recipes and instructions clearly while hands are occupied
- Scroll and zoom without touching the screen
- Highlight steps in recipes or instructions
- Adjust brightness for changing lighting

### Frustrations
- Touchscreens getting dirty or unresponsive
- Repeated hand washing to interact with devices
- Losing their place in instructions
- Fatigue from awkward hand gestures

### Accessibility & Constraints
- Hands temporarily unavailable or dirty
- Divided attention between tasks
- Gestures must be low-effort and one-handed
- Cannot perform precise or complex movements

### Design Implications
- Gestures must be simple and intuitive
- Visual feedback must be immediate and clear
- Interface must minimize cognitive load
- Gesture tolerance should account for gloves or temporary impairment

## Secondary Persona: User with Motor Impairment

**Name:** Maya  
**Age:** 29  
**Occupation:** Graduate student  

### Context
Maya experiences mild motor impairments, making precise touch difficult.
She reads content frequently (articles, research instructions, manuals)
and benefits from alternative input methods. This includes **lab and
home scenarios**, as well as **shared public computers**.

### Goals
- Scroll and read content without precise touch
- Adjust text size, brightness, and highlight easily
- Interact comfortably over extended periods
- Rely on simple, low-precision gestures

### Frustrations
- Small or precise touch targets
- Accidental taps or scrolls
- Interfaces requiring sustained precision
- Fatigue from holding arms up or repeated gestures

### Accessibility & Constraints
- Limited fine motor control
- Fatigue from prolonged interaction
- Prefers continuous rather than discrete gestures
- Needs adjustable gesture sensitivity

### Design Implications
- Gestures must be continuous and forgiving
- One-handed interaction is ideal
- Clear visual feedback is critical
- Avoid time-critical or high-effort gestures

## Persona Summary

The primary persona represents **situational accessibility**, covering cooking, lab, and shared/public display scenarios.  

The secondary persona represents **motor accessibility**, ensuring the system supports users with permanent or temporary fine motor limitations.

Together, these personas justify all gesture mappings, feedback mechanisms, and accessibility features in the project.
