# Personas

This project is designed around users who benefit from hands-free
interaction when traditional touch-based input is impractical or
inaccessible. The following personas were created to guide interaction
design decisions throughout the project.

## Primary Persona: The Home Cook

**Name:** Alex  
**Age:** 24  
**Occupation:** University student / young professional  

### Context
Alex frequently cooks at home while following online recipes displayed
on a laptop or tablet placed on the kitchen counter. During cooking,
their hands are often wet, greasy, or covered in food, making touch
interaction inconvenient and unhygienic.

### Goals
- Read recipes clearly while cooking
- Scroll through instructions without touching the screen
- Zoom in on specific steps when needed
- Avoid contaminating devices with food

### Frustrations
- Touchscreens becoming dirty or unresponsive
- Needing to wash hands repeatedly just to scroll
- Losing their place in a recipe while cooking

### Accessibility & Constraints
- Hands are temporarily occupied or dirty
- Attention is divided between cooking and reading
- Needs quick, low-effort interaction
- Cannot perform complex or precise gestures

### Design Implications
- Gestures must be simple and intuitive
- One-handed interaction should be sufficient
- Visual feedback must be clear and immediate
- Interface should minimize cognitive load

## Secondary Persona: User with Motor Impairment

**Name:** Maya  
**Age:** 29  
**Occupation:** Graduate student  

### Context
Maya experiences mild motor impairments that make fine touch interactions
difficult, especially when precise tapping or scrolling is required.
She regularly reads articles and instructions online and benefits from
alternative input methods.

### Goals
- Read content comfortably without precise touch input
- Control text size and brightness easily
- Avoid time-sensitive or complex gestures

### Frustrations
- Small touch targets
- Accidental taps or scrolls
- Interfaces requiring sustained precision

### Accessibility & Constraints
- Limited fine motor control
- Fatigue from prolonged interaction
- Prefers interactions that allow continuous adjustment

### Design Implications
- Gestures should be continuous rather than discrete
- Adjustable gesture sensitivity is important
- Interface must tolerate imprecise input
- No interaction should be time-critical

## Persona Summary

The primary persona represents **situational accessibility**, where
hands-free interaction is temporarily required. The secondary persona
represents **motor accessibility**, where alternative input methods
support more inclusive interaction.

Together, these personas guide the design of gesture mappings, feedback
mechanisms, and accessibility features throughout the project.
